# Copy All Tabs

A Firefox Add-on that takes the address and title for each tab and creates a text list of links. The list is copied to your clipboard so you can paste it to notes. You can also open tabs from a previously saved list of links.

This Add-on is available for Firefox here:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-all-tabs/?src=api

The extension is open source software. Source code is available here:
https://github.com/charlesbrandt/copy_all_tabs

This Add-on is similar in functionality to Copy All Urls on Chrome:

Pull requests are welcome!


## Development Process

Documentation for creating an extension has improved over the years. 

https://extensionworkshop.com/

The WebExtensions API is required in Firefox

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions

Generally, following along with a "getting started" guide helps:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension

### Installing

Open "about:debugging" in Firefox, click "This Firefox", click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select any file in your extension's directory 

When getting started with a custom extension manifest.json, I received:

    There was an error during installation: Extension is invalid

Check that the manifest.json is valid. In my case, I wasn't providing all parameters for the content_scripts option. Subtract and re-add elements until it passes to hone in on the part with a problem.

Click Inspect -> Console to see logging output

Reminder: Actions taken on Firefox `about:*` pages will not have any console output. Test with other tabs. 


#### Web-ext

An alternative way to run an extension for development

    npm install --global web-ext

For notes on using web-ext (but remember, 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext

I find loading in "about:debugging" is sufficient and easier


### Permissions

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#Clipboard_access


### Publishing

    cd copy_all_tabs/ff-web_extension 
    zip -r -FS ../copy-all-tabs.zip *

Log in and publish zip file. 


## History

This add-on is inspired by old add-on called CopyAllUrls (http://www.plasser.net/copyallurls/). I used that add-on for many years with Firefox (Thank you, JÃ¼rgen!). 

The current version has been updated to use the Web Extension API. 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions

It is loosely based on the structure of the example "tabs, tabs, tabs" extension.
https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/

Previous versions used Firefox's Add-ons SDK:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK

Functionality in the old version was available via the context menu. Right-click on a page to find "Copy Tabs" and "Paste Tabs".
